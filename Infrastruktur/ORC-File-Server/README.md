# ORC File Server

The ORC-NAS (Network Attached Storage) is our file storage server. It is intended for use by the labs and the press at HfG Karlsruhe.  

:warning: **Remember**: NAS only works "inside the HfG", if you are connected by cable or through eduroam. :warning:

If you would like to request an account, or encounter any problems, please contact us:

The Folder path has added the name of the Folder at the end:

``\\lagerraum.orc.hfg-karlsruhe.de\Commons``

- [x] Check ``Reconnect at sign-in`` / ``Verbindung bei Anmeldung wiederherstellen`` and let the other option unchecked
