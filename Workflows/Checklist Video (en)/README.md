- Battery charged, sufficient batteries?  
- Memory card in place and empty?  
- Is the time and date of the camera correct?
- Do you have a declaration of consent and an information sheet to display with you (notes on press photos)? If a photographer is present, coordinate with him or her.  
- How will the sound be recorded? If possible, connect the microphone directly to the camera; alternatively, bring a Zoom recorder (and cable).  
- If necessary, record additional portrait-format video for social media, for example with a smartphone.

## Set-up

- Obtain the consent of the speakers.  
- Display information sheet with information on press photos/video (if necessary, coordinate with photographer).  
- Ask the speaker to inform the audience that the event will be video recorded. Ask people who do NOT want to be recorded to sit to the side so that they are not in the picture.

## During the event
