Camera settings:  
- Are the time and date of the camera correct?

## Shortly before the start of the event

- Clarify with the organisers/speakers what the photos will be used for (website, social media, etc.).  
- Obtain the consent of the speakers.  
- Display information sheet with information on press photos/video (coordinate with photographer if necessary).  
- Ask the speaker to inform the audience that photographs will be taken during the event.

## During the event
:point_right: Switch between portrait and landscape format.

#### Photographs of the audience
People should not be recognisable, i.e. take photos from behind. In the case of larger groups, e.g. photos of the auditorium, no individual should stand out (refer to information sheet with notes on press photos, obtain consent by declaration if necessary).

#### Individual projects such as exhibitions
- First take a photo of the label, then one or more photos of the exhibit.
- If persons are recognisable in the picture, have them sign a declaration of consent.
- For unrecognisable persons (e.g. from behind, only part of the body), no declaration of consent is necessary (but it doesn't hurt to ask).

#### Conferences: vary perspectives
- Close-ups of the speakers, projection if necessary
- Speakers with audience (from behind), room panorama
- Interesting details, if relevant
